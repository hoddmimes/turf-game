Embedded environment
====================
 The access path is determined by definitions in
    - the embedded server i.e. com.hoddmimes.tomcat.Server
    - what is setup in the web.xml
    - the annotation def in the accutal rest service class i.e. com.hoddmimes.rest.TestService

    The access path for the Hello service in the embedded environment is
    http://localhost:8282/rest/rest/hello

    The port and first context "rest" path is defined in the actual embeded server i.e. com.hoddmimes.tomcat.Server
    The second "rest" path is defined in the file web.xml i.e the url-mapping for the classes defined for the Jersey services.
    The final service "hello" is determined by the @Path annotation  used in the Jersey implementation class i.e. com.hoddmimes.rest.TestService


    For none Jersey implementation the emmbedded server the first part i.e. port an first context path (as above)
    i.e. http://localhost:8282/rest/ The web.xml url-mapping detrmines the final part e.g
    http://localhost:8282/rest/test/Hello The web.xml servlet "Hello" has the url-mapping "/test/Hello"

TOMCAT environment
==================
The access path is determined by the following defnitions
   - the WAR name
   - what is setup in the web.xml
   - the annotation def in the accutal rest service class i.e. com.hoddmimes.rest.TestService

    The WAR name becommes the application prefix. E.g a WAR name frotz.war will result in a sub directory frotz being created in the Tomcat webapps directory.
    The application will then be available via the URL http://localhost:8282/frotz/...

    The setup in web.xml and the annotation are the same as in the embedded environment.
